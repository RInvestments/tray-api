# Flask site for sun dance.

Currently we use flask to provide easy to use API of the database info, for other web applications.
The entire flask site is organized under `/flask-site`.
It queries data from the mongodb database.


## How to run
```
export FLASK_APP=site-entry.py
export FLASK_DEBUG=1

python -m flask run

```

source run.sh


## Webservice Info
`site-entry.py` provides for main of the web based interface. Currently,
we provide some simple web based tools to get info from the database. We
also provide a API under `/api/` of the flask site. For a more detailed
and upto date info have a look at `site-entry.py` which defines an URL
and its associated callback functions.

Note that these call back functions
are not supposed to query the database directly, but it is to be done
using the `MongoQuery` class provided in file `MongoQuery.py`. This
class provides various functions to query the mongodb database. In the future
can create more classes to give access to various parts of database.

The api is organized into 2 parts.

    * Only ticker name is required, eg. company name etc, [here](#info), [here](#info-details)
