# Static Folder

This is the static part of the website. Basic idea is that these
javascript html pages will do XML-HTTP-request to the API and render
the data on the client-browser. This approach has the advantage that
front-end and the back-end are totally independent.

This is mainly a playground for trying out various javascript libraries
with my api. This part cannot contain any server generated content.
